## DELETE DUPLICATE

Given an array of n elements repeats,  remove the repeating data and return the 
new array. Some tests cases below:

``` javascript
console.log( deleteDuplicate([1,2,3,4,4,5,4,3,2,1,67,4,3]) )

> [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67 ]

console.log(deleteDuplicate( ["Juan","Pedro","Juan"] ));

> [ 'Juan', 'Pedro' ]
```


## BINARY SEARCH

 Search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Begin with an 
 interval covering the whole array. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of 
 the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly 
 check until the value is found or the interval is empty.

 The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(Log n).

 We basically ignore half of the elements just after one comparison:

- Compare x with the middle element.
- If x matches with middle element, we return the mid index.
- Else If x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in right half subarray after the mid element. So we recur for right half.
- Else (x is smaller) recur for the left half.



## Integer to Roman

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

| Symbol      | Value       |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| V           |  5          |    
| I           |  1          |
| X           |  10         |
| L           |  50         | 
| C           |  100        |
| D           |  500        |
| M           |  1000       |

For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.


Example 1:

Input: num = 3
Output: "III"
Example 2:

Input: num = 4
Output: "IV"
Example 3:

Input: num = 9
Output: "IX"
Example 4:

Input: num = 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
Example 5:

Input: num = 1994
Output: "MCMXCIV"
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

## Sum All Numbers in a Range

We'll pass you an array of two numbers. Return the sum of those two numbers plus the sum of all the numbers between them. The lowest number will not always come first.

For example, sumAll([4,1]) should return 10 because sum of all the numbers between 1 and 4 (both inclusive) is 10.

```javascript
sumAll([1, 4]) should return a number.

sumAll([1, 4]) should return 10.

sumAll([4, 1]) should return 10.

sumAll([5, 10]) should return 45.
```


## Diff Two Arrays

Compare two arrays and return a new array with any items only found in one of the two given arrays, but not both. In other words, return the symmetric difference of the two arrays.

Note: You can return the array with its elements in any order.

```javascript

diffArray([1, 2, 3, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) should return an array.

["diorite", "andesite", "grass", "dirt", "pink wool", "dead shrub"], ["diorite", "andesite", "grass", "dirt", "dead shrub"] should return ["pink wool"].

["diorite", "andesite", "grass", "dirt", "pink wool", "dead shrub"], ["diorite", "andesite", "grass", "dirt", "dead shrub"] should return an array with one item.

["andesite", "grass", "dirt", "pink wool", "dead shrub"], ["diorite", "andesite", "grass", "dirt", "dead shrub"] should return ["diorite", "pink wool"].

["andesite", "grass", "dirt", "pink wool", "dead shrub"], ["diorite", "andesite", "grass", "dirt", "dead shrub"] should return an array with two items.

["andesite", "grass", "dirt", "dead shrub"], ["andesite", "grass", "dirt", "dead shrub"] should return [].

["andesite", "grass", "dirt", "dead shrub"], ["andesite", "grass", "dirt", "dead shrub"] should return an empty array.

[1, 2, 3, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] should return [4].

[1, 2, 3, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] should return an array with one item.

[1, "calf", 3, "piglet"], [1, "calf", 3, 4] should return ["piglet", 4].

[1, "calf", 3, "piglet"], [1, "calf", 3, 4] should return an array with two items.

[], ["snuffleupagus", "cookie monster", "elmo"] should return ["snuffleupagus", "cookie monster", "elmo"].

[], ["snuffleupagus", "cookie monster", "elmo"] should return an array with three items.

[1, "calf", 3, "piglet"], [7, "filly"] should return [1, "calf", 3, "piglet", 7, "filly"].

[1, "calf", 3, "piglet"], [7, "filly"] should return an array with six items.
```


## Seek and Destroy

You will be provided with an initial array (the first argument in the destroyer function), followed by one or more arguments. Remove all elements from the initial array that are of the same value as these arguments.

Note: You have to use the arguments object.

```javascript

destroyer([1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], 2, 3) should return [1, 1].

destroyer([1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 2, 3], 2, 3) should return [1, 5, 1].

destroyer([3, 5, 1, 2, 2], 2, 3, 5) should return [1].

destroyer([2, 3, 2, 3], 2, 3) should return [].

destroyer(["tree", "hamburger", 53], "tree", 53) should return ["hamburger"].

destroyer(["possum", "trollo", 12, "safari", "hotdog", 92, 65, "grandma", "bugati", "trojan", "yacht"], "yacht", "possum", "trollo", "safari", "hotdog", "grandma", "bugati", "trojan") should return [12,92,65].
```


## Make a Person

Fill in the object constructor with the following methods below:

```javascript

getFirstName()
getLastName()
getFullName()
setFirstName(first)
setLastName(last)
setFullName(firstAndLast)
```

```javascript

Object.keys(bob).length should return 6.

bob instanceof Person should return true.

bob.firstName should return undefined.

bob.lastName should return undefined.

bob.getFirstName() should return the string Bob.

bob.getLastName() should return the string Ross.

bob.getFullName() should return the string Bob Ross.

bob.getFullName() should return the string Haskell Ross after bob.setFirstName("Haskell").

bob.getFullName() should return the string Haskell Curry after bob.setLastName("Curry").

bob.getFullName() should return the string Haskell Curry after bob.setFullName("Haskell Curry").

bob.getFirstName() should return the string Haskell after bob.setFullName("Haskell Curry").

bob.getLastName() should return the string Curry after bob.setFullName("Haskell Curry").
```


## Range of Numbers Recursive 

We have defined a function named rangeOfNumbers with two parameters. The function should return an array of integers which begins with a number represented by the startNum parameter and ends with a number represented by the endNum parameter. The starting number will always be less than or equal to the ending number. Your function must use recursion by calling itself and not use loops of any kind. It should also work for cases where both startNum and endNum are the same.


```javascript
Your function should return an array.

Your code should not use any loop syntax (for or while or higher order functions such as forEach, map, filter, or reduce).

rangeOfNumbers should use recursion (call itself) to solve this challenge.

rangeOfNumbers(1, 5) should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

rangeOfNumbers(6, 9) should return [6, 7, 8, 9].

rangeOfNumbers(4, 4) should return [4].
```


## Filtered Array

We have defined a function, filteredArray, which takes arr, a nested array, and elem as arguments, and returns a new array. elem represents an element that may or may not be present on one or more of the arrays nested within arr. Modify the function, using a for loop, to return a filtered version of the passed array such that any array nested within arr containing elem has been removed.


```javascript
filteredArray([[10, 8, 3], [14, 6, 23], [3, 18, 6]], 18) should return [[10, 8, 3], [14, 6, 23]]

filteredArray([["trumpets", 2], ["flutes", 4], ["saxophones", 2]], 2) should return [["flutes", 4]]

filteredArray([["amy", "beth", "sam"], ["dave", "sean", "peter"]], "peter") should return [["amy", "beth", "sam"]]

filteredArray([[3, 2, 3], [1, 6, 3], [3, 13, 26], [19, 3, 9]], 3) should return []

The filteredArray function should utilize a for loop
```


## Largest Numbers in Arrays

Return an array consisting of the largest number from each provided sub-array. For simplicity, the provided array will contain exactly 4 sub-arrays.


```javascript
largestOfFour([[4, 5, 1, 3], [13, 27, 18, 26], [32, 35, 37, 39], [1000, 1001, 857, 1]]) should return an array.

largestOfFour([[13, 27, 18, 26], [4, 5, 1, 3], [32, 35, 37, 39], [1000, 1001, 857, 1]]) should return [27, 5, 39, 1001].

largestOfFour([[4, 9, 1, 3], [13, 35, 18, 26], [32, 35, 97, 39], [1000000, 1001, 857, 1]]) should return [9, 35, 97, 1000000].

largestOfFour([[17, 23, 25, 12], [25, 7, 34, 48], [4, -10, 18, 21], [-72, -3, -17, -10]]) should return [25, 48, 21, -3].
```
